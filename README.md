# Requirements: Python 3.9, PTB 20.1.....

# Functions & Features: (note that in the example file, u represents the Aozora webpage of the book 『陰翳礼讃』, y represents the Aozora webpage of the book 『吾輩は猫である』)

1. Usage of the commands /u and /y
Send the bot a command (/u, /y) followed by a Japanese word and it will fetch sentences containing the word from two books for you: /u <word> or /y <word>

For example, send the following to make the bot fetch and send a random sentence containing the word 友人 every 100 minutes (i.e. 6000 seconds) from the webpage:
/set_timer_u 6000 友人
(After setting up the timer job, you could also send /unset_u, /unset_y to cancel it!)
